Once Cloudflare deploys (2-3 minutes):
`https://bootstrap-theme.jhws-website.pages.dev/bootstrap-index`

### Local Testing
```bash
cd jhws-website
git checkout bootstrap-theme
npm run dev
```
Then visit: `http://localhost:4321/bootstrap-index`

## 📊 Comparison: Original vs Bootstrap

### Original Theme
- Custom CSS
- Simple, clean design
- Traditional layout
- Minimal animations
- Good for content-focused sites

### Bootstrap Theme
- Bootstrap 5 framework
- Modern, dynamic design
- Card-based layouts
- Smooth animations and gradients
- Phone mockup showcases
- More visual impact
- Professional tech/startup feel

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Review the Bootstrap Theme
Visit the preview URL and test on:
- Desktop browser
- Mobile phone
- Tablet

### 2. Provide Feedback
Consider:
- Do you like the modern design?
- Is the content well-organized?
- Are the phone mockups effective?
- Does it match your vision?

### 3. Choose Your Path

**Option A: Use Bootstrap Theme**
```bash
# Replace main index with bootstrap version
git checkout bootstrap-theme
mv src/pages/bootstrap-index.astro src/pages/index.astro
git add .
git commit -m "Switch to Bootstrap theme"
git push origin bootstrap-theme

# Then merge to dev or main when ready
```

**Option B: Keep Original Theme**
- Simply don't merge the bootstrap-theme branch
- Keep using the original design
- Bootstrap theme remains available for future reference

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Keep both versions
- Use Bootstrap for home page
- Keep original styling for other pages
- Or vice versa

## 🔧 Customization Options

If you want to customize the Bootstrap theme:

### Change Colors
Edit `public/bootstrap-css/styles.css`:
- Look for gradient color definitions
- Modify primary/secondary colors
- Adjust background colors

### Modify Layout
Edit `src/pages/bootstrap-index.astro`:
- Rearrange sections
- Add/remove content blocks
- Adjust spacing and sizing

### Add More Pages
Create new pages using the same Bootstrap structure:
```astro
---
// New page
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Same head content -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your content here -->
  </body>
